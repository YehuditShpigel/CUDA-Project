# Visionnairy.ai-ISP-project. 

a little piece of my graduate project. 

my project was translating [Visionary.AI](https://www.visionary.ai/) company image processing code from Python to C++ and CUDA.  

Since the main part of my project is protected by NDA, I can't share it. 

Here there are only additions that were used but the magic algorithm itself is under protection. 

1. pool design pattern 
2. convolution in cuda implementation
