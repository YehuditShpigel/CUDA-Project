# Visionnairy.ai-ISP-project.

this is a little piece of my graduate project

Translating Visionary.AI's image processing code from Python to C++ and CUDA. 

Since the main part of my project is under NDA, I can't share it.

Here there are only additions that were used but the algorithm itself is under protection.
